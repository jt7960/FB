Project Definition

Reinvent fantasy basketball and create a game that;
	* improves on the shortcomings of fantasy basketball as it exists today
	* leverages the addictive qualitities of fantasy football 
	* Corrects the aspects of current the fantasy basketball format that tends to cause users to lose interest

Create a fantasy basketball site that will allow for custom league schedules.
 We believe that shorter leagues would attract a casual audience much like fantasy football.

Users will be able to login and view their fantasy rosters, create leagues and invite 
  other members, have teams in multiple leagues. Rosters will be filled via a draft 
  system and can be updated throughout the season by performing trades or waiver wire/free 
  agent additions. Each player will have a player profile page consisting of current and 
  past statistical information, as well as, recent news stories involving said player.

**Below is a list of sections/items that will need to be built out. These can be addressed 
    in milestones and task lists. New sections/items should be added, as needed, to this list.**
